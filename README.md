# YOLO-Haarcascade-Emotion-Recognition-with-Real-Time-Face-Detection
This project implements real-time emotion recognition using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model for face detection and a Haarcascade classifier. The emotion detection is powered by a CNN trained on the FER-2013 dataset, classifying seven emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
